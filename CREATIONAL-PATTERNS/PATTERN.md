### Creational Design Patterns
* _Singleton_ Pattern [code](singleton/singleton2.ts)
* _Factory_ Pattern [code](O.ts)
* _Pool_ Pattern [code](L.ts)


#### Singleton
* Singleton is used to have a single instance of a class in your entire application  
* One of the benefits of using Singleton is shared state  
* Most commonly used to hold application configuration 

#### Factory
* Factory pattern is usually a combination of single responsibilty and open/closed principles  
* Delegation of creating objects to factory class so that the client does not have to know how the objects are built.
